= OpenSim.Region.OptionalModules =

The modules in this part of the OpenSim source tree are candidates for
forge. For the time being, until we have reached consensus on

    (a) what should be core or optional
    (b) that we have reached a stable API
    (c) how to maintain optional modules

we will keep these modules in-tree.
